- **Mock Posts**: Sample confessions with different attributes
- **Mock Communities**: Test communities with various configurations
- **Mock Notifications**: Different notification types and states

## Coverage Goals

### Target Coverage Metrics
- **Service Layer**: 90%+ line coverage
- **Screen Widgets**: 85%+ line coverage
- **Integration Flows**: 80%+ scenario coverage
- **Error Handling**: 100% error path coverage

### Critical Paths
1. User authentication flow
2. Post creation and submission
3. Data loading and display
4. Error handling and recovery
5. Navigation and state management

## Continuous Integration

### Automated Testing
